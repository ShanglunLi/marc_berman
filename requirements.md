# Requirements to Run the Tutorial


- A working Python 3 environment with a PyTorch 0.4 install (and Jupyter, of course). Details at: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)
- Preferably, a computer with a GPU. Google Cloud has great options, as does AWS. Alternatively a University of Chicago GPU such as Acropolis from Social Science Computing Services or the servers at the Research Computing Center.
- Optionally, a working R environment, and an R kernel set up for Jupyter.

### *NOTE*: 

> - For those who haven't installed PyTorch before, a strong warning about NVIDIA drivers. They really are a pain and are easy to mess up. You will be on your own for setup, since every NVIDIA card / CUDA version / CUDNN version / PyTorch version / OS distro and version seems to present its own challenges. It's much easier to install PyTorch for CPU only, however, and in a pinch that will do.
> - An earlier version of PyTorch will most likely work, but 0.4 would be desirable.
